        <!-- Welcome Content -->
        <p>Welcome and Thank You for Choosing <strong>Interstellar Services Private Limited</strong> (“Company”)!</p>

        <p>We are pleased to welcome you and introduce you to a unique offering curated by the Company - a bundled
            overseas travel support package that includes access to global travel assistance services along with a
            travel insurance policy, underwritten by a leading insurance company in India.</p>

        <p>This value-added offering has been thoughtfully designed to enhance your travel experience and provide peace
            of mind during your journey. While the Company has facilitated and marketed this bundled product for your
            convenience, please note that the travel insurance and travel assistance services are independently provided
            by third-party service providers with whom you are directly connected through this arrangement.</p>

        <p>The Company does not underwrite, issue, or service the insurance policy, nor does it provide travel
            assistance services. Our role is limited to facilitating access to this bundled solution and assisting you
            in connecting with the respective service providers.</p>

        <p>The terms, conditions, coverage details, claims process, and servicing of the travel insurance policy are
            governed by the issuing insurance company. Similarly, the travel assistance services will be rendered by the
            respective travel assistance company as per their own terms of engagement.</p>

        <p>We strongly encourage you to carefully read and understand the insurance policy wordings and the service
            terms provided by the respective service providers to fully understand the scope of coverage and assistance
            available to you.</p>
